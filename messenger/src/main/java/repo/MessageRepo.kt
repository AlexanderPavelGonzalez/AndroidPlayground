     * Yes, use suspend for any function that might block the main thread, such as network calls,
     * database operations, or heavy computations. This allows the function to run asynchronously
     * without freezing the UI, following best practices in Kotlin and Android development.
     *
     * suspend is used for functions that perform long-running or blocking operations (like network
     * or database calls) so they donâ€™t freeze the UI.
     * withContext(Dispatchers.IO) moves the work to a background thread optimized for IO tasks,
     * keeping the main thread free for UI updates. This is best practice in Android/Kotlin to
     * ensure smooth, responsive apps.
