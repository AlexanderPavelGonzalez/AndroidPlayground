## Overview

Hello!

Welcome to my Android playground! This project is an experimental Android application designed as a sandbox for exploring and implementing modern Android development techniques. It is intended for learning, prototyping, and demonstrating best practices in Android app architecture and performance.

### Key Features
- **Jetpack Compose**: The UI is built entirely with Jetpack Compose, Android's modern toolkit for building native interfaces.
- **Dagger**: Dependency injection is handled using Dagger, ensuring modular, testable, and maintainable code.
- **Modularization**: The codebase is split into multiple modules (e.g., `app`, `infra`, `messenger`, `networking`) to promote separation of concerns and scalability.

## Project Structure
- `app/` – Main application module and entry point
- `infra/` – Infrastructure and shared utilities
- `messenger/` – Example feature module (messaging)
- `networking/` – Networking abstractions and utilities
...

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the repository**
2. **Open with Android Studio** (Giraffe or newer recommended)
3. **Build and run** on an emulator or device

## Why this project?
This playground is a personal space to:
- Experiment with new Android APIs and libraries
- Practice clean architecture and modularization
- Test performance optimizations
- Try out Compose UI patterns

Feel free to explore, learn, and contribute!
